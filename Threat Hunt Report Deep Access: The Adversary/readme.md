Scenario 
For weeks, multiple partner organizations across Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe detected odd outbound activity to obscure cloud endpoints. Initially dismissed as harmless automation, the anomalies began aligning.

Across sectors — telecom, defense, manufacturing — analysts observed the same patterns: irregular PowerShell bursts, unexplained registry changes, and credential traces mimicking known red-team tools.

Then came a break. A tech firm flagged sensitive project files leaked days before a bid was undercut. An energy provider found zipped payloads posing as sync utilities in public directories.

Whispers grew — not one actor, but a coordinated effort. Code fragments matched across unrelated environments. The beaconing continued: quiet, rhythmic pings to endpoints no business could explain.

Some suspect Starlance — an old, disbanded joint op revived. Others say mercenary crews using supply chain access and familiar tooling.

What’s clear: this wasn’t smash-and-grab. It was long game.

Your task: trace the access, map the spread, and uncover what was touched — or taken. Two machines hold the truth, scattered and shrouded.

No alerts fired. No passwords changed.
But something was here…
…and it might return.
